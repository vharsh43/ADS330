Topic - Cloud (WEB) Operation System.

Description - These is an operating system where you get a benefit to access from anywhere without the need of a network connection to a 
remote PC. If there is a private company and they want to use our operating system then it should be connect with the internally hosted 
private domain where all the user of that comapny can access their required application then it will be well secure, faster and 
relaiable for that company. It manages as well as it operates and executes the process of virtual infrastructure like virtual machines, 
virtual servers, hardware and software resources within the cloud environment. It is also known as Virtual Operating System. Cloud OS 
will allow to better usage of data center resources including network, storage and computing. It is designed to enhance the user or 
employee productivity and faster and better delivery of applications across the three clouds of private, public and hybrid with improved 
security and compliance. Cloud OS give access to the users to a variety of applications which will allow the users to complete simpler 
and light-end tasks without the need of developing a full-fledged operating system. There is a benefit of the stand-alone cloud 
operating system is that there is very less use of hardware in it and this will save your money.

Challenges - 
1) There was a one challanging thing regarding desktop that to show to user all apps and configuration that looks like desktop which was 
   one of the major challanging task for the us.   
   
2) Security issues is also an challanging task as every company has it own privacy and security policies. we are not able to see the     
   exact location where your data is stored or being processed. This will increase the cloud computing risks that can arise at the time
   of the implementation or management of the cloud.

3) Lack of resources or expertise as there are more workloads in the cloud because of this reason any of the organization are having     
   issue with the tools or application.

4) Complaince is one the challanging issue facing in cloud computing. This issue is related backup services or cloud storage. Every     
   organization moves data from the internal storage to a cloud every time, it is faced with being compliant with industry regulations   
   and laws. Cloud cutomers have to look for the vendor that provide complaince which will help customer's company a lot.

5) Managing multiple clouds is also challanging issue facing in the cloud computing.

6) To build a private cloud is not the priority for every company as private solutions should be carefully addressed.

7) We think that one of the major issue is about migration which is faced computing industry. This process works when we move           
   application to cloud. There are few challanges we faced when we store data in the cloud are security challange, troubleshooting,     
   downtime for the application and many more.
   
   
Description to reproduce project – 

Cloud computing has been seen as one of the technologies that give rise to the next-generation computing revolution and rapidly becomes the trending point in the ﬁeld of IT (Information Technology). As there is a fast move towards Cloud computing has concerns on some point for the success of information systems, virtualization, communication and integrity, scientiﬁc application, and information security. Therefore, cloud computing will be in great demand in coming years. In our operating system we are providing application for user to work on it. We can design application as like Microsoft Azure which can be run installed on our web OS (Operating System). The cloud OS is designed to provide a configurable interface for developing and deploying the applications on behalf of large number of users, storage and bandwidth provided by the cloud infrastructure.  
In Future, we are thinking of adding new features in our operating system. Where we will add new software application to our page where user can easily access everything at one place. It will store everything in our database. As of now, we have just shown that how’s our operating system looks like. In our Web OS at the bottom of the bar all the apps are not working as of now, it is only for view purpose. We will implement in future that things and make everything working well and well. In future, Ecosystems will be a feature of driving cloud adoption in many industries, however the customers and cloud vendors need to collaborate to help to work together in creating them.
    
Introduction
Cloud operating system is considered as a high technology operating system. Cloud is a simplified operating system that run in a web browser, where we can provide ample of web-based applications that allow user to perform simple tasks without any king od booting a full-scale operating system. It is used for managing a cloud infrastructure. This is will allows user to access and upload their files from any location in the cloud. As we combine the browser with a basic operating system allows the use of cloud computing and in that application as well as data “live” and “run” on the internet instead of hard drive. However, cloud can be installed and can be used with another operating system, or it can act as standalone operating system. For our simple cloud operating system, we will show you step wise how the user can Sign-up and then Sign-in with that account and how it looks like after you Login-In in the webpage. 


1 - LOGIN

Login Page of Web Operating System where you can see the Sign-In option as well as create account option. In this page user can write their username and Password and hit Sign-In button if user has an account. If not, user can click on create account and it will take you to Sign-up page. 

2 – SIGNUP (Optional)
  
Sign-Up page where user can create an account if they don’t have an existing account. Basically, user need to fill given information Email, Username, Avatar, Password correct and then click on Sign-up button. 
After clicking on Sign-Up button, it will take you to home page and there you need to Sign-In by your existing account with correct information. Your all information in the Sign-up page with store in our database and it will allow you to Sign-In if all the information is correct in our Login-In page.

3 – Home Screen

Once, you put all the information correct and hit Sign-In you will see how’s our operating system looks like. There you will find your username at the right top corner of the navigation bar and your avatar beside it. We have also added the time and day at the right top corner of the navigation bar which will show you “Live time”.

4 - Dock
 
At the bottom of the page, we have added few things which user might use regularly. In our operating system, we have just showed to the user that how it looks like. Right now, all apps at the bottom of page is not working as it is only for the view purpose. In future, we will show them how it works in our operating system. 

5- Applications (Future Development) 
 
Once user is logged-In, they will have the Macintosh Desktop Experience (version 10.7.1). In addition, user can have the information about this Mac OS X where they can see that what the processor, memory and Startup virtual disk of Mac. There is also one video of UofR (University of Regina) they can click on the play button to view that video. User can close the tab by clicking on red cross button on each of the tab.

6- Navigation Menu (Logout)
 
At last, after everything is done now is the time for logout from the page. To logout, user need to go left top corner of the navigation bar where you will the symbol of apple. Once, you put your cursor on it you will find few options and at last there will be the option of Log-Out. After clicking on it, you will see the home page same as you had seen in step 1.
